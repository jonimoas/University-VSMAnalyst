Part of my collection of university projects

The project operates in two phases.

First you need to run java/main/main in order to generate the docterm matrices.
Then you execute matlab/vsm in order to generate the results.

ATTENTION : the input/output files locations are hardcoded in those two files, if
you want to change said locations, you need to make alterations to the code.
